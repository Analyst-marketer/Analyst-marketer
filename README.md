    <blockquote>
      <p>
      "Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company, serves two types of customers: casual riders and members. Casual riders are those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while members are those with annual subscriptions. Finance analysts have determined that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. The Director of Marketing believes that increasing the number of annual members is crucial for the company’s long-term success and growth.
The marketing analytics team aims to explore differences in bike usage between casual riders and members to develop targeted strategies for converting casual riders into annual members. The primary stakeholders include the Director of Marketing and the Cyclistic Executive Team.
As a newly joined Junior Data Analyst on the Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team, your role is to identify trends and analyze customer bike usage to support the company’s goals."
